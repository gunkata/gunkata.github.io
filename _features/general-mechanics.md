### Global Game Speed

The Global Game Speed is an overall modifier to all things that move. As the game progresses, the Global Game Speed increases making it more difficult for the player. There will be effects in the game that decrease the Global Game Speed, however, these effects will only be temporary and the game will resume at the speed that it was previously before the effect.

### Hit-Stop

When a bullet kills an enemy, all enemies will stop moving for a brief moment. Hit Stop will help the player set the pace for the multitude of enemies that approach the player at once. The small amounts of time that each kill gives will add to the player's advantage. If the player is fast enough, the Hit Stop may overlap, resulting in a longer period in Hit Stop.

### Bullet Time

Bullet Time is similar to _Hit Stop_ but occurs randomly and slows down the enemies rather than fully stop their movement. This will be another tool that is activated by killing an enemy. The speed will be fixed meaning that regardless of the _Global Game Speed_ the Bullet Time will set the Global Game Speed to a set value rather than reduce it by a set amount. Bullet Time lasts longer than Hit Stop but should not overlap in time, meaning you cannot activate another Bullet Time whilst it's already active.
