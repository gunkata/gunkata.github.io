The player controls a stationary character situated in the center of the screen. The character wields two guns which they point down the 8 lanes that surround them. The player has to defend themselves from oncoming enemies that travel down the 8 lanes.

### Twin Stick Aiming/Shooting

The player has control of two guns wielded in both hands of the character. Each gun is controlled with a single joystick (_Keyboard controls TBD_) and used to aim down each lane. Although the joystick has full 360 degree range, the guns will snap to the closest lane to where the joystick is pointed. The guns can be shot separately from each other using the respective triggers on the controller (_RT/LT, R2/L2, ZR,ZL_).

### Red/Blue Guns

The player wields two guns, the red gun in their right and blue gun in their left. When the player shoots either gun, a bullet of the same colour will spawn from that gun. Depending on the enemy, the bullets shot will have a different effect. These guns have unlimited ammo. Other guns that are acquired by killing an enemy equipped with a gun will have limited ammo. _See armoury for more information_.

#### Purple Bullets

Aiming both guns down the same lane will result in shooting _Purple_ bullets from both guns. These purple bullets will be able to kill _Purple enemies_, however, a purple bullet still behaves the same as a regular bullet when shooting blue or red enemies - the red gun for red enemies and blue for blue enemies.

### Camera Rotating

The player has the ability to rotate the camera. The camera rotates around the character in 45 degree increments and can be rotated in both directions. Although the camera has rotated, the angles the player aims will remain the same rather than keep its original direction. E.g. tilting the joystick up will always aim the gun in the above north of the character.

### Life

The player has 10 lives that they lose when an enemy reaches them. Depending on the _Spawn Instance_, the number of lives lost when the _Spawn Instance_ reaches the character changes.

Lives lost if the _Spawn Instance_ has:
- 1-2 enemies = 1 Life
- 3-4 enemies = 2 Lives
- 5-6 enemies = 3 Lives
- 7-8 enemies = 4 lives
