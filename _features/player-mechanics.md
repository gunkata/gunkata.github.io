### Twin Stick Aiming/Shooting

The player has control of two guns wielded in both hands of the character. Each gun is controlled with a single joystick (_Keyboard controls TBD_) and used to aim down each lane. Although the joystick has full 360 degree range, the guns will snap to the closest lane to where the joystick is pointed. The guns can be shot separately from each other using the respective triggers on the controller (_RT/LT, R2/L2, ZR,ZL_).

### Red/Blue Guns

The player wields two guns, the red gun in their right and blue gun in their left. When the player shoots either gun, a bullet of the same colour will spawn from that gun. Depending on the enemy, the bullets shot will have a different effect.

#### Purple Bullets

Aiming both guns down the same lane will result in shooting _Purple_ bullets from both guns. These purple bullets will be able to kill _Purple enemies_, however, a purple bullet still behaves the same as a regular bullet when shooting blue or red enemies - the red gun for red enemies and blue for blue enemies.

The player has the ability to rotate the camera. The camera rotates around the character in 45 degree increments and can be rotated in both directions. Although the camera has rotated, the angles the player aims will remain the same rather than keep its original direction. E.g.
