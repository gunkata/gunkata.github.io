Weapons will spawn on enemies which will display an icon above their head. Once an enemy is killed the player will  wield the gun(s) until all ammo is used from that gun. If the player happens to kill multiple enemies whilst wielding another weapon other than his pistols the weapon will end up in a queue. Once the weapon they are currently using runs out of ammo, the next weapon last added to the queue will be equipped. The player will continue to use the looted weapons until there are none in the queue.

The gun that kills the enemy will be equipped in the same hand. Different hands can have different guns. In terms of the queue, there will be two queues for each hand.
