Special guns will appear in the game that help the player kill enemies easier. These guns are limited in use and will have special effects and properties to them that differ from your default pistol. Most of these guns will shoot special ammo that can kill any type of enemy so the player will not have to worry which gun they use.

### How to acquire

Guns will randomly spawn on enemies which will display as an icon above their head. When the player kills that enemy, they will wield the gun in the hand/side that was used to kill that enemy. This means that they will be able to wield two different guns at the same time. If the player with the gun equipped kills another enemy that has a different gun type, the player will equip the gun that the enemy has and throw away their current gun. Similarly, if the player kills an enemy with a gun of the same type as the one on an enemy, the amount of shots left on the gun is "reloaded" (_The player throws away the gun to use the newly acquired one_).
