Skills will be another tool at the player's disposal that activate after the player reaches the certain number of kills. The number of kills for each skill is determined by selecting a number within a range set E.g. _Black out_ will require kills between 80 - 200. A skill will activate once the number of kills has been met and will reset the number of kills required to be activated again.

### Skills

#### Screen Wipe

When this skill activates, all enemies on the screen will be killed. This skill may have different effects to show how the enemies have died, but this skill's intentions should be a reset for the player. This will not kill enemies offscreen unless their _Spawn Instance_ appears on the screen. Enemies may appear offscreen due to wide screen resolutions. Although their _Spawn Instance_ appears first on the left and right of their character, the top and bottom enemies will be offscreen if there are any. Enemies will stop moving until the skill taken effect to which the enemies will gradually return to the normal speed.

#### Black Out

This skill will turn all enemies grey for 10 seconds. Newly spawned enemies will be grey until the timer is up. Once the timer is up enemies spawning will continue as before.

#### Armour Piercing bullet

Regardless of which gun, this skill will make the next bullet shot from either gun similar to a Sniper Rifle's bullet. The player will only get one bullet to use between both guns and the bullet will kill all enemies within the lane. The difference between this and a Sniper Rifle should be that the screen will not zoom out and the player only has one shot.

#### Adrenaline Rush

When this skill activates the movement of all enemies will slow down for 10 seconds. Hit Stop and Bullet Time can still take effect when this skill is active and will last longer. The skill simply slows down the movement of the enemies. The player and other elements should still move at the same speed.
