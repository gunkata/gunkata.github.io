          <h2 id="elevator-pitch">Elevator Pitch</h2>
<p>Gun Kata is a Twin Stick 8 Directional Survival Action Shooter where the player controls a character that wields two guns. The character controls each gun separately and has to defend themselves from oncoming enemies.</p>

<h2 id="game-vision">Game Vision</h2>
<p>The game, Gun Kata, will teach the player about hand eye coordination through the use of twin stick shooting. Having two guns, the player needs to feel surrounded and overwhelmed however, it should feel good to get rid of the enemies so there needs to be some form of impact. Also, this game isn’t a rhythm game but may possess elements of a rhythm game.</p>

<h2 id="player-objective">Player Objective</h2>
<p>For the base game mode the player’s objective is to defend themselves from oncoming waves of enemies before they lose all their lives. There will be multiple game modes with different objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Survival - Clear X amount of enemies before the player runs out of lives</li>
  <li>Timed - Survive until the time runs out</li>
  <li>Endless - Kill as many enemies as you can before the player runs out of lives</li>
</ul>
